# Pseudo pixel shift
using your cell phone camera

## Motivation and project scope

My motivation at the moment is based on two desires:
* get more megapixels from my cellphone camera (it is irrational, I know, please don't question this aspect)
* do the above using what I already have with no additional investments in licenses and hardware

Nowadays we have a lot of cameras using [pixel shift technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shift), some of them have pixel shift handheld mode. And I think the number of those will grow with time. But New camera is always an investment, and who needs new camera nowadays if 10 year camera do a pretty good job of making a good quality pictures?  How about using your smartphone if you use one? It has a camera already, so... you don't have to get your camera all the time (but you can surely use one with even better results!).

Is there a cheaper way to get a pixel shift? Yes! There is!

There is well known article which describes handheld pixel shift (can't find it at the moment, I'll put here a link when I find it) where resolution of the final image has been increased 4 times by averaging few images.

Before we go into details, there are merits and demerits of the classical pixel shift and pseudo pixel sift:

Classic (hardware) pixel shift:

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| More megapixels :) | Static scenes |
| Less noise | Tripod is obligatory | 
| Less chromatic aberrations |  |

Pseudo pixel shift (the one which is described here):

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| More megapixels :) | Static scenes (there may be pedestrians or moving cars as long as there are static objects in the frame) |
| Less noise | Some post processing work is still necessary to achieve a good result | 
| You are using your cell phone which is always with you ;) ||
