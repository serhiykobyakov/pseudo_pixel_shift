# Superresolution
using your cell phone camera and free software

Some technical background is necessary to use this software. And also you'll need:
* smartphone with camera
* PC with Linux (or Windows if you can adapt the scripts for this system)
* Imagemagick, Python (along with OpenCV) installed

## Motivation and project scope

My motivation is based on two desires:
* get better images (more megapixels less noise etc.) using my cellphone camera. (it is irrational, I know, please don't question this aspect)
* do the above using what I already have with no additional investments in licenses and hardware

There is [well known article which describes how to get superresolution images](https://petapixel.com/2015/02/21/a-practical-guide-to-creating-superresolution-photos-with-photoshop/), but photoshop is a part of the process there.

Before we go into details, there are merits and demerits of the superresolution technique:

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| More megapixels :) | Static scenes (there may be pedestrians or moving cars as long as there are static objects in the frame) |
| More fine details compared to the camera native images | Requires extra efforts compared to point and shoot | 
| Less noise compared to the camera native images | |
| You are using your cell phone which is always with you ;) ||
